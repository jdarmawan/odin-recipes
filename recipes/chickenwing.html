    <img src="https://www.grillkameraden.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Chicken-Wings-selber-machen-750x450.jpg">
    <p>Baked chicken wings are so easy to make, and they come out of the oven crispy and delicious. There's no need for flour!</p>

    <p>Simply bake them in a 400Â°F oven for 40 minutes. And if you want them extra-crispy, leave them in a warm oven for 30-60 more minutes</p>
    Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh chicken wings</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    How to make:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Toss the wings in melted butter (or even just liberally spray them with oil) and sprinkle them with spices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange them on a rimmed baking sheet fitted with a wire rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake until fully cooked, well-browned, and wonderfully crispy!
        </li>
    </ol>
