    Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>
    Steps
    <ol>
        <li>
            Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.
            Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolor the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan. Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking. Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.
